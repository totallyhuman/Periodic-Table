# Periodic Table

~~(wait, github already includes a line :P)~~

------

This is a Periodic Table written in HTML, made by this dude @totallyhuman because he needed it urgently for a chemistry test of his. It is designed for high schoolers.

 It contains the following information about the elements:

- Valence electrons of groups (except for the transition metals :c)
- Ionization charges of groups (still no transition metals)
- Atomic number
- Atomic symbol
- Element name
- Atomic mass
- Element type (you know; transition metals, noble gases, etc.)

Feel free to clone and/or print for usage!

Status: WIP; six rows done, no font size or family whatsoever, need to clear it out and make separate stylesheet
